Lights-Out-Game
===============

Developed in C++, this board game uses a file which stores a five by five grid of numbers (zeros and ones) or lights. One    means on and zero means off. A random number of these lights is switched on by default. Inputting any    row and column numbers will toggle it and the four adjacent lights. Supported by a play menu, the goal    of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off.
